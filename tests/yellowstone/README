This directory contains the tests that should be run on NCAR's Yellowstone
compute system.  The general order of operations is described below:

1) Run Tests

   runtestsi.py: Run any number of selected tests as individual jobs
                 submitted to the queue.  This uses a single Specifier
                 for each PyReshaper job, and each job runs in parallel
                 with all of the other jobs.
                    
   runtestsm.py: Run any number of selected tests as a single job submitted
                 to the queue.  This uses a list of Specifiers for a single
                 MultiSpecReshaper job.
                    
2) Check Test Results

   checkresults.py: Compare output from each test that has been run with
                    accepted results (found in /glade/u/tdd/asap/bakeoff)
                    
3) Get Timing Data

   gettimings.py: Read the PyReshaper output for each test that has been run
                  and extract the timing data from the output logs.  Add this
                  timing data to the 'timings.json' database.
                  
4) Additional

   Additional useful scripts can be found in the postproc/ directory,
   including the following:
   
      getsizes.py: Reads the test input data and computes test information
                   such as variable sizes and numbers.  The information is
                   printed to STDOUT.
                   
      mkplots.py: Creates typical timing and throughput plots from information
                  found in the 'timings.json' database.
